Null model-based analysis of microbial community beta diversity to infer ecological processes.

# Null Model-Based Analysis of Microbiome Beta Diversity

This repository provides data and code for studying microbial beta diversity using null model approaches to understand underlying ecological processes.

## 🧬 Background

Beta diversity measures differences in microbial composition across samples. By applying null models, we can determine whether observed patterns deviate from random expectations and infer processes such as selection, dispersal, and ecological drift.

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `data/`: Raw and processed input data.
- `scripts/`: Python and R scripts for data processing and analysis.
- `results/`: Output files including beta diversity matrices and visualizations.
- `docs/`: Supporting documents and references.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- R 4.1+
- Python packages: `pandas`, `scikit-bio`, `matplotlib`
- R packages: `vegan`, `phyloseq`, `picante`

## 🚀 Running the Analysis

```bash
python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
Rscript scripts/null_model_analysis.R
python scripts/beta_diversity_plot.py
```
## 📊 Methods
Beta diversity metrics: Bray-Curtis, Jaccard, UniFrac
Null model: Raup-Crick (RC_bray, RC_unifrac)
Statistical testing: PERMANOVA, Mantel test
Visualization: NMDS, PCoA
